    "## 🎯 Part 1: Why RAG Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are incredibly powerful, but they have critical limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Cutoff** - They only know what they were trained on (e.g., GPT-4 trained on data up to April 2023)\n",
    "2. **Hallucination** - They can confidently make up information\n",
    "3. **No Access to Private Data** - They can't access your documents, databases, or internal knowledge\n",
    "4. **Static Knowledge** - They can't learn new information after training\n",
    "\n",
    "### How RAG Solves This\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG = Retrieval + Augmentation + Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval**: Find relevant information from your knowledge base\n",
    "2. **Augmentation**: Add that information to the LLM's prompt\n",
    "3. **Generation**: LLM generates an answer grounded in the retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you:\n",
    "- ✅ Up-to-date information\n",
    "- ✅ Access to private data\n",
    "- ✅ Reduced hallucination\n",
    "- ✅ Source attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG vs Fine-Tuning vs Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | What It Does | Best For |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| **RAG** | Adds knowledge to prompts | New information, private data, facts |\n",
    "| **Fine-tuning** | Changes model behavior | Style, format, domain-specific tasks |\n",
    "| **Prompt Engineering** | Optimizes prompts | Simple tasks, no code changes needed |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** RAG handles *knowledge*, fine-tuning handles *behavior* — they're not either/or!\n"

    "## 🏗️ Part 2: The RAG Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG architecture has two main phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Indexing (One-time setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load your knowledge base** - Documents, PDFs, text files, etc.\n",
    "2. **Split into chunks** - Break documents into manageable pieces\n",
    "3. **Convert to vectors** - Use an embedding model to create vector representations\n",
    "4. **Store in Vector DB** - Save vectors for fast retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Query (Real-time)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User asks a question** - \"What are the key findings?\"\n",
    "2. **Embed the query** - Convert the question to a vector\n",
    "3. **Find similar chunks** - Search the vector database for relevant documents\n",
    "4. **Add context to prompt** - Combine retrieved chunks with the original question\n",
    "5. **LLM generates answer** - The model uses the context to answer\n",
    "6. **Return grounded response** - Answer with source attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INDEXING:\n",
    "Knowledge Base → Chunks → Embedding Model → Vector DB\n",

    "## 🔢 Part 3: Embeddings Deep Dive\n",

    "### What are Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are **vector representations of text** that capture semantic meaning. Similar texts have similar vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Similarity** - \"dog\" and \"puppy\" are close in vector space\n",
    "2. **Fixed Dimensions** - Each embedding has a fixed size (e.g., 1536 for OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small)\n",
    "3. **Distance = Meaning** - Closer vectors = more similar meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Embeddings Matter\n",

    "| **Document-aware** | Split by headers, sections, pages | Structured docs (markdown, HTML) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use overlap** - 10-20% overlap prevents losing context at boundaries\n",
    "2. **Respect structure** - Don't split in the middle of sentences\n",

    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with access to external knowledge sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How RAG Works\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems work in two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Indexing\n",
    "1. Documents are loaded from various sources (PDFs, databases, APIs)\n",
    "2. Documents are split into smaller chunks\n",
    "3. Each chunk is converted to a vector using an embedding model\n",
    "4. Vectors are stored in a vector database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Querying\n",
    "1. User asks a question\n",
    "2. Question is converted to a vector\n",
    "3. Vector database finds similar document chunks\n",
    "4. Retrieved chunks are added to the LLM prompt\n",
    "5. LLM generates an answer based on the retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces hallucination by grounding answers in real data\n",
    "- Allows access to up-to-date information\n",
    "- Enables use of private/internal documents\n",
    "- Provides source attribution for answers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use appropriate chunk sizes (typically 500-1000 characters)\n",
    "2. Include overlap between chunks (10-20%)\n",
    "3. Choose the right embedding model for your domain\n",
    "4. Test retrieval quality before optimizing generation\n",
    "5. Use metadata filtering when possible\n",

    "### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Complete RAG system with:\n",
    "- Document loading\n",
    "- Intelligent chunking\n",
    "- Vector embeddings\n",
    "- Vector database storage\n",
    "- Retrieval-augmented Q&A\n",
    "- Evaluation tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAG = Retrieval + Augmentation + Generation**\n",
    "2. **Chunking is critical** - Bad chunking = bad results\n",
    "3. **Test retrieval before generation** - Garbage in, garbage out\n",
    "4. **Embeddings enable semantic search** - Similar meaning = similar vectors\n",
    "5. **Vector databases scale** - Fast similarity search at scale\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Try with your own documents** - Replace the sample document with your PDFs/text files\n",
    "2. **Experiment with chunk sizes** - Find what works best for your data\n",
    "3. **Try different embedding models** - Some models work better for specific domains\n",
    "4. **Add metadata filtering** - Filter by date, source, category before retrieval\n",
    "5. **Implement hybrid search** - Combine vector search with keyword matching\n",
    "6. **Add reranking** - Use a cross-encoder to improve top results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangChain Docs**: https://python.langchain.com/\n",
    "- **ChromaDB Docs**: https://docs.trychroma.com/\n",
    "- **OpenAI Embeddings**: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings\n",
    "- **RAG Evaluation**: Consider using RAGAS (https://docs.ragas.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a RAG system on YOUR data this week! Start simple, iterate, and remember:\n",
    "- **Start simple** - Basic RAG with good chunking beats complex RAG with bad data\n",
    "- **Test retrieval first** - If retrieval is bad, nothing else matters\n",
    "- **Iterate** - RAG is an iterative process, not a one-time setup\n",
